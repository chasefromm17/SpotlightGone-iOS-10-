# SpotlightGone for iOS 10

NOTICE/SMALL DISCLAIMER: I will release SpotlightGone for iOS 10 source code soon... it just takes time. Currently it is unknown at all if SpotlightGone10 will work on 32-bit (iPhone 5, iPhone 5C or iPad 4) on any iOS 10 version jailbroken with h3lix. The SpotlightGone for iOS 10 .deb file, however, will (and should...) be available soon too for installation via Filza, AFC2, and SSH install as well and in this repository, and will be posted in the "/bin" subdirectory.

**Description**: SpotlightGone hides both the widgets view and the Spotlight page from your homescreen on your iOS 10 device.

**Tested on**: Two iPhone 5 models - both running iOS 10.3.3, for ARM64-bit, tested on an iPhone 5S running iOS 10.2, two iPad Air 1 models - both running iOS 10.1.1, etc. Not yet tested on my iPhone SE running iOS 11.0.3.

**License**: Licensed under the MIT license.

**Credits**: Credits to me for making this. You may reproduce and reuse this software, but please credit me if you can for making this.

**Repo for installation and download**: You will have to wait for it to be available for ARM32-bit devices.
