# SpotlightGone for iOS 10

NOTICE: I will release SpotlightGone for iOS 10 source code here soon... it just takes time. Currently it is unknown at all if SpotlightGone10 will work on 32-bit (iPhone 5, iPhone 5C or iPad 4) on any iOS 10 version. The SpotlightGone for iOS 10 .deb should be available too for installation via iFile/Filza, AFC2, and SSH install as well and in this repository will be posted in the /bin directory.

**Description**: SpotlightGone hides both the widgets view and the Spotlight page from your homescreen on your iOS 10 device.

**Tested on**: Two iPhone 5 models - both running iOS 10.3.3, for ARM64-bit, tested on an iPhone 5S running iOS 10.2, two iPad Air 1 models - both running iOS 10.1.1, etc. Not yet tested on my iPhone SE running iOS 11.0.3.

**License**: Licensed under the MIT license.

**Credits**: Credits to me for making this. You may reproduce and reuse this software, but please credit me if you can for making this.
