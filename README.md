Will release SpotlightGone for iOS 10 source code here soon... just takes time. Currently it is unknown at all if SpotlightGone10 will work on 32-bit (iPhone 5, iPhone 5C or iPad 4) on any iOS 10 version. Should work on 64-bit, tested on my iPhone 5S running iOS 10.2, and will have @CydiaGeek test on his iPhone 7 running iOS 10.1.1 soon. The SpotlightGone for iOS 10 .deb should be available too for installation via iFile/Filza, AFC2, and SSH install as well and in this repository will be posted in the /bin directory.
