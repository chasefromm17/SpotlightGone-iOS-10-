Will release SpotlightGone for iOS 10 source code here soon... just takes time. Unknown if it'll work on 32-bit (iPhone 5, iPhone 5C or iPad 4) on iOS 10, hopefully it will. Works on 64-bit, tested on iOS 10.2 on my iPhone 5S running iOS 10.2, and will have @CydiaGeek test on his iPhone 7 running iOS 10.1.1 soon if I need to. SpotlightGone for iOS 10 .deb should be available too for installation via iFile/Filza, AFC2, and SSH install as well.
